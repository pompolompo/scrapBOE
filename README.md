# Public auctions in Spain: scrapBOE

Spanish state can auction all kinds of goods and rights for different purposes. These auctions are held electronically at [Portal de Subastas](https://subastas.boe.es/) and most information is publically avaiable. 

The goal of this project is to develop an application to scrape, store and analyse auction data.
